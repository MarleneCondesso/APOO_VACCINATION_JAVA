All the work presented in this repository is for educational porpuses, as well as demonstrating my approach to this course. I do not advise you to copy, the professors are very strict and have a very good algorithm for identifying code copied from a student that has already completed the course, and in case of foul play you may end up failing the curricular unit instantly. Do not cheat.
